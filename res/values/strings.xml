	    For those who don\'t know what Chidiya Udd is, it\'s a game, usually played with multiple opponents with all of them putting the tip of their index finger on the ground (here on coloured Circles).
	    One person will call out the name of anything and depending on whether the thing can fly they should lift their fingers from the ground. If it can fly, you\'ve to lift your finger up momentarily
	    and then put it down for the next turn or else if it doesn\'t fly, you\'ve to continue keeping it on the ground. The people failing to do the right action loses the game.\n\n

		This game has three modes:\n
		1) <b>Single</b> - You\'ve three lives here. Each mistake you make makes you lose a life. The more you keep scoring the higher your score will be. Simple!\n\n

		2) <b>Versus</b> - Two players play and the one reaching 100 first wins. Here, for each fault, you get -10 and for each correct one +10.\n\n

		3) <b>Tournament</b> - A maximum of 4 players can play and rules are similar to the versus mode. However, if few players reach 100 together, then they proceed to the next round and so on until a clear winner emerges.\n\n

		<b>So, flex your finger muscles and get ready for Chidiya Udd!</b>
